What is TCAMpy?
===============

A single python module for a cellular automaton modeling tumor growth. The user can set the parameters, create unique
initial states, view and save statistics, save data and also use a streamlit dashboard as a graphical interface. Growth
plots, histograms and animation is available for visualization in an easy to use way.

The theoretical background for this model is based on the work of Carlos A Valentim, Jos√© A Rabi and Sergio A David.

Theoretical Background
======================

Getting Started
===============
To get started with this project, follow the instructions below.

1. Install the necessary dependencies using `conda install` or `pip`.
2. Clone the repository and set up your environment.

Usage
=====
After you installed TCAMpy and it's dependencies (which should be automatically installed with TCAMpy)
you can start using the model. First, you import the module, then create a 'TModel' class, like this:

.. code-block:: python

    import TCAMpy as tcam

    M = tcam.TModel(50, 500, 10, 1, 24, 1/24, 15, 4)

The 'TModel' class takes a number of parameters. These determine the area, the different probabilities as well as the duration
of the model. See :ref:`api-docs` for further details about them. After you've created the class with the parameters of your
choice, you can simply run the entire model with one command:

.. code-block:: python

    M.run_model(animated = False, stats = True)

This function automatically creates an initial state with a STC in the middle of the field. In every cycle, for the duration
of the model, it checks the entire area and chooses an action for each tumor cell. The output includes multiple plots:
a growth plot, a cell number plot and a histogram of the proliferation potentails. If the 'stats' parameter is set to true,
various statistical properties of the model will be printed about the field and the cells. If 'animated' is set to true, the
function returns an animation of the growth. Note that animation does not work while using 'inline' backend. You must change
the backend first.

You can also modifiy the initial state by calling the following functions before running the model:

.. code-block:: python

    M.init_state()
    M.mod_cell(x, y, value)

This function modifies the value of the cell at the (x, y) coordinates. For example, if you want to add another STC at (10,20),
use this command with x = 10, y = 20 and value = M.pmax + 1. You can change the initial state as much as you'd like before running
the model. You can also remove the automatically created STC by changing it's value to 0.
